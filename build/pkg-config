# This script is a wrapper for pkg-config that always uses our PKG_CONFIG_PATH settings.
#
# If meson is started with --pkg-config-path used as a command line argument, meson will overwrite the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.
#
# This wrapper was introduced because of the vcpkg PR: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/pull/38901
# For further disscussion, see: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/40305
